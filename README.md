# MULESOFT-ASSESMENT

I learned a lot of things about databases, drivers, and their relevant java coding from this assessment, which was incredibly beneficial and educational for me. I selected to use the SQLite software library for this assessment instead of an RDBMS, and I used JDBC drivers to connect to the database and perform DDL and DML operations on the appropriate database.

Task assigned : 

Step-1 Connect to a SQLite database (or another one you are familiar with): Find out how to download the SQLiteJDBC driver and connect to a SQLite database that already        exists using JDBC.

Step-2 Learn how to use the SQLiteJDBC driver or a related driver to create a new SQLite database from a Java (or other language) application.

Step-3 Creating a new table (Movies) using JDBC / Other Languages – before working with data, you need to create a table called Movies. Learn how to create a new table          in an SQLite database from a Java (any language) program.

Step-4 Inserting data into Movies table from a Java (any language) program

Step-5 Querying data from Movies table with or without parameters – after having the movies data in the table, you need to query the movie details (name, actor, actress,        director, year of release) using a SELECT statement. You will need to write a program to issue a simple SELECT statement to query all rows from the Movies table,        as well as use a query with parameter like actor name to select movies based on the actor's name.

The repository contains all of the Java code files.
